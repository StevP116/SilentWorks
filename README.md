## SilentWorks
Whenever a student gets a notification or phone call during a meeting or lecture their phone distracts everyone in their vicinity. These constant notifications are detrimental to the concentration of everyone in the room and leaves a bad impression on other students and the professor.

### API Use
While testing the code straight from the Github repo, one won't be able to connect to the API without creating an Android Client credential with their personal SHA1 signature in our project on the Google Cloud Platform. Please email Stephen Paoli at smpaoli@wisc.edu to share the project with you on the Google Cloud Platform, so the correct Android Client can be created, and the application can be properly assessed.
